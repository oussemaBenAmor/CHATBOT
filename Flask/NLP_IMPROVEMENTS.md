# NLP Improvements for Chatbot System

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the NLP (Natural Language Processing) component of the chatbot system to enhance transaction type detection and provide more focused, relevant answers.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Transaction Type Detection
- **Multi-method approach**: Combines keyword matching, semantic similarity, and key phrase extraction
- **Confidence scoring**: Provides confidence levels for detected transaction types
- **Expanded keyword sets**: More comprehensive synonyms and variations for each transaction type

#### Transaction Types Supported:
- **Refunds**: refund, return, credit, money back, reimbursement, repayment, cash back, chargeback
- **Payments**: payment, pay, card, bank, cash, transfer, credit card, debit card, online payment
- **Transfers**: transfer, move, send, wire, bank transfer, money transfer, electronic transfer
- **Exchanges**: exchange, swap, trade, replace, substitution, conversion

### 2. Intelligent Question Focus Extraction
- **POS tagging**: Identifies nouns, verbs, and adjectives as focus words
- **Key phrase extraction**: Uses spaCy's noun chunks and named entities
- **Question word detection**: Recognizes what, how, when, where, why, which, who

### 3. Advanced Relevance Scoring
- **TF-IDF similarity**: Measures word frequency and importance
- **Semantic similarity**: Uses spaCy's vector similarity for meaning-based matching
- **Keyword overlap**: Direct word matching between question and answers
- **Key phrase similarity**: Phrase-level matching for better context understanding

### 4. Focused Answer Generation
- **Intent-based formatting**: Different answer formats based on question type
- **Relevance filtering**: Only shows information directly related to the question
- **Smart summarization**: Limits output to prevent information overload

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```bash
scikit-learn==1.3.0  # For TF-IDF and cosine similarity
numpy==1.24.3        # For numerical operations
```

### Key Functions

#### `detect_transaction_type(question: str) -> Tuple[str, float]`
- Combines multiple detection methods with weighted scoring
- Returns transaction type and confidence score
- Threshold-based filtering for accuracy

#### `extract_question_focus(question: str) -> List[str]`
- Extracts key words and phrases from questions
- Uses POS tagging and key phrase extraction
- Filters out stop words and punctuation

#### `calculate_relevance_score(sentence: str, question_focus: List[str], question_doc) -> float`
- Multi-metric relevance scoring
- Combines TF-IDF, semantic, and keyword similarity
- Weighted combination for optimal results

#### `filter_relevant_sentences(sentences: List[str], question_focus: List[str], question_doc, threshold: float = 0.25) -> List[str]`
- Filters sentences based on relevance threshold
- Returns top 8 most relevant sentences
- Prevents information overload

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Refund Question
**Question**: "How do I get a refund for my purchase?"
- **Detected Type**: refunds (confidence: 0.85)
- **Focus Words**: ['refund', 'purchase', 'how']
- **Answer Format**: Step-by-step instructions

### Example 2: Payment Question
**Question**: "What payment methods do you accept?"
- **Detected Type**: payments (confidence: 0.78)
- **Focus Words**: ['payment', 'methods', 'what']
- **Answer Format**: List of payment options

### Example 3: Transfer Question
**Question**: "Can I transfer money between accounts?"
- **Detected Type**: transfers (confidence: 0.82)
- **Focus Words**: ['transfer', 'money', 'accounts']
- **Answer Format**: Transfer process explanation

## Benefits

1. **Better Accuracy**: Multi-method detection reduces false positives
2. **Focused Answers**: Only relevant information is provided
3. **Improved UX**: Users get exactly what they asked for
4. **Scalability**: Efficient processing even with large document sets
5. **Maintainability**: Modular design with utility functions

## Configuration

### Similarity Thresholds
- **Transaction Detection**: 0.2 (lower for broader matching)
- **Sentence Relevance**: 0.25 (balanced precision/recall)
- **Semantic Similarity**: Uses spaCy's built-in thresholds

### Model Selection
- **Primary**: `en_core_web_md` (medium model for better similarity)
- **Fallback**: `en_core_web_sm` (small model for compatibility)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_nlp.py
```

This will test:
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Transaction type detection
- Question intent extraction
- Answer formatting

## Future Enhancements

1. **Context Awareness**: Remember conversation history
2. **Learning**: Improve from user feedback
3. **Multi-language**: Support for additional languages
4. **Custom Training**: Domain-specific model fine-tuning
5. **Performance**: Optimize for real-time responses
